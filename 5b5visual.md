Regulation 5b5

規則5b5

“If some parts of the puzzle are physically detached or not fully placed at the end of the solve, the following regulations apply (...)”

「若在解方塊階段結束後，方塊的一些零件掉出或是沒有完全歸位，則依照下面規則判定（...）」

Regulation 5b5f

規則5b5f

“If a piece is partially detached or not fully placed, its final position is the closest position in which the affected piece would normally fit within the puzzle mechanism, considering the current state of the puzzle. If the final position renders the piece solved, the piece is not considered to be affected by the puzzle defect”

「如果一個零件部分分離或是未完全歸位，考慮方塊當下的狀態，這個零件的最終位置將被視為一般正常情況下最接近的位置。如果最終的位置能讓方塊成功還原，則這個零件不被視為方塊故障。」

Considerations

需考慮的事項

• Pieces completely detached are still covered by 5b5a, 5b5b, 5b5c and 5b5d.

• 完全分離的零件仍然適用規則5b5a、5b5b、5b5c和5b5d。

• This wording aims to follow the usual intuition: “If the piece is near to where it should be, the piece is solved”.

• 以下的文字是以一般的直覺為原則：「如果該零件在它應該存在的位置附近，則該零件視為完成位置」

• The final state of the piece depends on the current state of the puzzle.

• 某零件的最終狀態要依據該方塊的現有狀態來決定。

• Once the final position has been determined, that position and orientation needs to be judged in order to know if the puzzle is either solved or not.

• 

• Some particular cases may need to be judged by a Delegate (just like a close +2 misalignment).

Examples

範例

Remember: The final position of the piece is the closest position in which it would normally fit within the puzzle mechanism, considering the current state of the puzzle. 

In other words: A position is valid if it is possible to operate (not necessarily solve) the puzzle without issues, when the piece is placed in such position.

Example 1

範例1

Past: DNF.
Now: Solved.

The only place where the piece would normally fit, is the place where the piece is solved.

A 4x4 mechanism does not allow the wing to be twisted on its spot, so that is not a valid position to consider.

Example 2 

範例2

Past: DNF. 
Now: Solved. 

Given the definition of “piece” in  Regulation 5b6, here we have 3  pieces partially detached. 

However, all of them are closer to  their solved place. Therefore, no  pieces are considered to be  affected. 

# Page 8
Example 3 

範例3

Past: DNF. 
Now: Delegate discretion.

The closest valid position is either the solved state, or the “corner twist” state. The Delegate should carefully evaluate which state is the closest to the current one.

# Page 9
Example 4

範例4

Past: DNF.
Now: Solved.

The only valid place available for the corner is the correct one. 

The orientation of the piece seems to be closer to the solved orientation.

# Page 10
Example 5

範例5

Past: DNF.
Now: DNF.

The only valid place available for the corner is the correct one. However, the orientation of the piece does not render the piece solved in any case.

# Page 11
Example 6

範例6

Past: DNF.
Now: DNF.

Difficult edge case. The blue center piece at the left seems to be taking the space of the yellow center piece (which is now far from its correct place).

Considering that the yellow one is now partially detached, the closest valid spot for it is in the blue face. This leads to a final state with two unsolved pieces.

# Page 12
Example 7

範例7

Past: DNF.
Now: +2.

Several pieces affected, but all of them are closer to their correct place.

The puzzle is solved with a misalignment penalty.

# Page 13
Example 8

範例8

Past: DNF.
Now: Solved.

Despite the piece may be closer to the red square’s position, the affected piece does not normally fit in such position (the mechanism does not allow it). 

Therefore, the closest valid position is the correct one.

# Page 14
Example 9

範例9

Past: DNF.
Now: DNF.

This case is still DNF as per Regulation 5b5d, because of the missing red-green edge piece.

# Page 15
Example 10

範例10

Past: DNF.
Now: DNF.

As opposed to Example 1, the “twisted” position is valid in terms of mechanism. 

For this reason, the closest valid position does not render the piece solved.

# Page 16
Explanation

As you have seen, the 4x4 is considered solved, but the 3x3 is not. But why?

The reason is simple: Remove one edge piece from a 4x4 puzzle (i.e. one of the orange-blue edge pieces). 

Now try to put it back in the puzzle, but upside down. As you can see, the mechanism does not allow that. It is not a valid position to consider.

Try the same experiment, but with a 3x3 edge piece. You will get an impossible state, but the piece fits in such position. As it is a valid position, it may be the final one (and the result, given the orientation, is an unsolved puzzle; DNF).
