Regulation 5b5

“If some parts of the puzzle are physically detached or not fully placed at the end of the solve, the following regulations apply (...)”

# Page 3
Regulation 5b5f

“If a piece is partially detached or not fully placed, its final position is the closest position in which the affected piece would normally fit within the puzzle mechanism, considering the current state of the puzzle. If the final position renders the piece solved, the piece is not considered to be affected by the puzzle defect”

Considerations

• Pieces completely detached are still covered by 5b5a, 5b5b, 5b5c and 5b5d.

• This wording aims to follow the usual intuition: “If the piece is near to where it should be, the piece is solved”.

• The final state of the piece depends on the current state of the puzzle.

• Once the final position has been determined, that position and orientation needs to be judged in order to know if the puzzle is either solved or not.

• Some particular cases may need to be judged by a Delegate (just like a close +2 misalignment).

Examples

Remember: The final position of the piece is the closest position in which it would normally fit within the puzzle mechanism, considering the current state of the puzzle. 

In other words: A position is valid if it is possible to operate (not necessarily solve) the puzzle without issues, when the piece is placed in such position.

Example 1

Past: DNF.
Now: Solved.

The only place where the piece would normally fit, is the place where the piece is solved.

A 4x4 mechanism does not allow the wing to be twisted on its spot, so that is not a valid position to consider.

Example 2 

Past: DNF. 
Now: Solved. 

Given the definition of “piece” in  Regulation 5b6, here we have 3  pieces partially detached. 

However, all of them are closer to  their solved place. Therefore, no  pieces are considered to be  affected. 

# Page 8
Example 3 

Past: DNF. 
Now: Delegate discretion.

The closest valid position is either the solved state, or the “corner twist” state. The Delegate should carefully evaluate which state is the closest to the current one.

# Page 9
Example 4

Past: DNF.
Now: Solved.

The only valid place available for the corner is the correct one. 

The orientation of the piece seems to be closer to the solved orientation.

# Page 10
Example 5

Past: DNF.
Now: DNF.

The only valid place available for the corner is the correct one. However, the orientation of the piece does not render the piece solved in any case.

# Page 11
Example 6

Past: DNF.
Now: DNF.

Difficult edge case. The blue center piece at the left seems to be taking the space of the yellow center piece (which is now far from its correct place).

Considering that the yellow one is now partially detached, the closest valid spot for it is in the blue face. This leads to a final state with two unsolved pieces.

# Page 12
Example 7

Past: DNF.
Now: +2.

Several pieces affected, but all of them are closer to their correct place.

The puzzle is solved with a misalignment penalty.

# Page 13
Example 8

Past: DNF.
Now: Solved.

Despite the piece may be closer to the red square’s position, the affected piece does not normally fit in such position (the mechanism does not allow it). 

Therefore, the closest valid position is the correct one.

# Page 14
Example 9

Past: DNF.
Now: DNF.

This case is still DNF as per Regulation 5b5d, because of the missing red-green edge piece.

# Page 15
Example 10

Past: DNF.
Now: DNF.

As opposed to Example 1, the “twisted” position is valid in terms of mechanism. 

For this reason, the closest valid position does not render the piece solved.

# Page 16
Explanation

As you have seen, the 4x4 is considered solved, but the 3x3 is not. But why?

The reason is simple: Remove one edge piece from a 4x4 puzzle (i.e. one of the orange-blue edge pieces). 

Now try to put it back in the puzzle, but upside down. As you can see, the mechanism does not allow that. It is not a valid position to consider.

Try the same experiment, but with a 3x3 edge piece. You will get an impossible state, but the piece fits in such position. As it is a valid position, it may be the final one (and the result, given the orientation, is an unsolved puzzle; DNF).
